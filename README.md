# simon-html

This deliverable demonstrates the use of basic HTML elements for structure, basic formatting, input, output, links, and drawing.

My notes:
It has been interesting to look at the HTML here. It definitely looks different than a lot of the HTML I have seen and used on a typical website. Once thing I am trying to understand is how it looks different when you hover over one of the colors or click one of the colors without using CSS.

This application deliverable demonstrates the use of basic CSS for styling and a responsive design.

My notes:
I have been trying to center a section on my startup and struggling a bit to make it look right. I want to try align-items and justify-content, which are in the main.css document for Simon, and see if that helps. Otherwise, the CSS seemed pretty straightforward.
