# simon-html
This deliverable demonstrates the use of basic HTML elements for structure, basic formatting, input, output, links, and drawing.

My notes: It has been interesting to look at the HTML here. It definitely looks different than a lot of the HTML I have seen and used on a typical website. Once thing I am trying to understand is how it looks different when you hover over one of the colors or click one of the colors without using CSS.

# simon-css
This application deliverable demonstrates the use of basic CSS for styling and a responsive design.

My notes: I have been trying to center a section on my startup and struggling a bit to make it look right. I want to try align-items and justify-content, which are in the main.css document for Simon, and see if that helps. Otherwise, the CSS seemed pretty straightforward.

# simon-javascript
This deliverable demonstrates the use of basic JavaScript for interactivity.

My notes: I am still trying to get comfortable with JavaScript because of my extremely minimal programming experience. I definitely don't understand everything on the play.js file yet, but I'm getting there.

# simon-service

This deliverable demonstrates converting the JavaScript application into a web application by implementing a web service that listens on a network port for HTTP requests.

My notes: I learned a lot reading through the instruction for this assignment. Like the JavaScript, I still feel like a have a lot to learn about creating a service. However, I'm excited to learn more about it while working on my startup.

# simon-db

This deliverable demonstrates using a database service, MongoDB, to persistently save data.

My notes: I learned about using MongoDB to store data. Adding that functionality changed less things than I expected. I'm still figuring out how to use this on my startup project.

# simon-login

This deliverable demonstrates authenticating users and storing credentials and authentication tokens in MongoDB.

My notes: I am excited to add login abilities to my startup. I always wondered how website logins worked on the backend so it has been helpful to see the Simon code.

# simon-websocket

This deliverable demonstrates peer to peer communication using WebSocket.

My notes: I am still getting familiar with WebSocket, but I think it's one of the most interesting technologies we have learned about in the class so far. I can't imagine a lot of apps without peer-to-peer communication.

# simon react

My notes: Going through Simon React in class today was really helpful. I'm not planning to convert my startup to a React application, but I do plan on learning React pretty soon, so this Simon application will be a great resource.
