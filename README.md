# simon-html

This deliverable demonstrates the use of basic HTML elements for structure, basic formatting, input, output, links, and drawing.

My notes:
It has been interesting to look at the HTML here. It definitely looks different than a lot of the HTML I have seen and used on a typical website. Once thing I am trying to understand is how it looks different when you hover over one of the colors or click one of the colors without using CSS.

# simon-css

This application deliverable demonstrates the use of basic CSS for styling and a responsive design.

My notes:
I have been trying to center a section on my startup and struggling a bit to make it look right. I want to try align-items and justify-content, which are in the main.css document for Simon, and see if that helps. Otherwise, the CSS seemed pretty straightforward.


# simon-javascript

This deliverable demonstrates the use of basic JavaScript for interactivity.

My notes:
I am still trying to get comfortable with JavaScript because of my extremely minimal programming experience. I definitely don't understand everything on the play.js file yet, but I'm getting there.
